Algorithm:

check_fermat:
    Formula:
        chk = (a**n) + (b**n) = (c**n)
        (Values are given by users in the main function)
    if chk is false:
        print "Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!"
    if chk is true:
        print "No, that doesn't work..."

main:
    Introduce program:
        print "This program will test Fermat's Last Theorem with user specified numbers"
    Get values of a, b, c, and n
        get input for a, with prompt "What is the first number?    "
        get input for b, with prompt "What is the second number?    "
        get input for c, with prompt "What is the third number?    "
        get input for n, with prompt "What is the value of the exponent? (Press Q to quit)   "
    if n is greater than 2:
        Run check_fermat with values of a, b, c, and n
        if chk returns false:
            print "Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!"
        if chk returns true:
            print "No, that doesn't work..."
        while chk is true:
            run main until false or given command to quit the while loop
    if n is not greater than or equal to 2:
        run main again and print "the exponent must be greater than 2"
    if n is equal to 2:
        run check_fermat with values of a, b, c, and n
        if chk returns false:
            print "Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!"
